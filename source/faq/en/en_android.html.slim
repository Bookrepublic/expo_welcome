        |  version.
      li
        | Once Aldiko is installed you will be asked to authorize it with your Adobe ID, this is, to associate it with the personal profile that will allow you to open and read all of your ebooks. This is possible by simply entering the credentials with which you have created your Adobe ID, at the bottom under "Information on Authorisation".

          | If you donâ€™t know what an Adobe ID is or you have to create one,

      | Note: if after you have downloaded ebook files on your Android tablet you cannot find them, download

      li
        | Now back to your order: you can return to your order either via the link we sent you via email upon purchase or via your account on the site. Save the file of your ebook. At this point you just need to use the file browser that you have already downloaded to find your file and open it with Aldiko.
