      | Got a new e-reader? Heard of ebooks and curious to know if there is really a different way to read? You're in the right place! The ebook is the new form of book: it is lighter (you can take plenty of them without making your bag heavier), it is more accessible (you purchase it with one click at any time of day and wherever you are, you just need an Internet connection) and it is cheaper (ebooks cost less than paper books). But these are just some of the advantages of the ebook. If you want to discover the others you just have to take the first steps. And we are here to accompany you :)
