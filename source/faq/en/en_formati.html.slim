      | Ebook formats
    p
      | An ebook is a book in digital format. This means that it isnâ€™t printed on paper, but it is a file. Like all files, even ebooks are saved on your computer with a name followed by a dot and a sequence of letters called an extension. A possible extension for music files, for example, is ".mp3", the for text files ".doc". The extension is used to understand the format of the ebook, which is important because not all e-readers can read all ebook formats. The two most common formats are mobi and epub. So, for example, if the name of a file is "ebook", then a digital book will be a file called ebook.epub, ebook.pdf or ebook.mobi. But be careful: if the ebook you bought is protected by Adobe DRM, before downloading the ebook you will receive a file with the extension ".ACSM". The icon with which your computer represents the file depends on the program used to open it.
